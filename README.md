# ARBrickEditor
=======================

Thesis project for Msc. Games - Technology Track at the IT-University of Copenhagen.

AR game for Android developed in Unity, using [WFC](https://github.com/selfsame/unity-wave-function-collapse) to generate a level in a platformer based on the [Lego Microgame](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/lego-microgame-179847). The input for WFC is given by scanning a LEGO plate, which is done using [OpenCV](https://github.com/mryndzionek/scanner).
